The programme takes two lists as inputs:

city_nodes: a list of city names as nodes
city_edges: a list of tuple pairs that represent connections between the cities
Output
The programme outputs a dictionary where each key represents a city node and its value is a list of cities connected to that node.

2) Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory and 
run the following command: `python city_graph.py`
